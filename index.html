        <p class="lead mb-4">I'm a student at UC Riverside currently studying biochemistry (weird I know) and art design. Ever since I was little, I've always been drawn to the arts as a way to not only express yourself but connect with people on a level that is unique to the arts. I began my journey in music as many kids do not only consuming and playing music but also writing it. My experience however was not just limited to instruments; it encompassed all forms of music from singing to dancing to songwriting and producing, etc. From there, I also quickly discovered my love of art whether it'd be through clay or paint or even just sketches on some random napkin I found in my lunchbox. The environment I was in allowed me to nurture these skills until they become the predominant part of my life and my daily activities. Thus once I graduated high school and came to college, I knew that no matter what I did,it has to be something that allowed me to fluorish creatively and expand my horizons. As such, I have elected to work as a designer in hopes of joining the echelon of art directors across the world..<br><br>
        I am a creative and self-driven design professional with 3+ years of experience creating and delivering elegant, innovative design solutions that excite consumers and grow iconic brands. I'm skilled in leading multiple projects from concept through to completion and I am hands-on in transforming complex information and concepts into attractive, human-centered designs. I am an expert at interdepartmental coordination and communication and I am skilled with Adobe Creative Suite (Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign) Microsoft Office and web design applications (Dreamweaver, HTML). I truly guarantee that I will be able to stretch the boundaries of web design and digital storytelling to help my clientâ€™s brands stand out.  As a designer, it is my job to optimize a branded approach to real-time engagement with your customers to not only maximize company profit but also customer enjoyment. My personal philosophy is about creating pieces that not only intrigue the audience with its beauty but also about pieces that are able to speak to them and allow them to feel the emotions that the brand carries. Whether it's delivering on a warm environment that allows people to feel at home or a serene environment that allows people to feel at ease, I truly want to create designs that speak to people on a personal level. After all, the key to truly engaging customers and forming a loyal customer base is to follow a customer-oriented model and interact with them in order to form that relationship and enhance brand recognition. <br><br>
